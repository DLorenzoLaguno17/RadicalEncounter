Radical Encounter is a God Game in which the player is in charge of a group of activists that are defending their little village against a series of different enemy soldiers which will try to
subdue your fellow citizens and friends. Those evil soldiers are going to attack them and also damage the buildings and the
infrastructure of the place, so you will have both to assist the people and repair the patrimony, all with the help of the resources you will acquire by slaining and saving your comrades.

## Areas
- **Camp:** The camp is the safest area of the town. In it, there are all the hospital tents and the majority of the activist forces, and it is the most important place if they want to survive. It must be kept safe from the enemy at all cost.
- **Urban center:** The urban center is where most of the action is developed, and there is where all three different types of characters interact with each other.
- **Outskirts:** The outskirts are from where all the enemies will enter the city. There are two different accesses, one of the north of the city and the other at its south.
