# Radical Encounter
Radical Encounter is a god game in which you are in charge of a group of activists that are defending their little village against a series of different enemy soldiers which will try to
subdue your fellow citizens and friends. Those evil soldiers are going to attack them and also damage the buildings and the
infrastructure of the place, so you will have both to assist the people and repair the patrimony, all with the help of the resources you will acquire by slaining and saving your comrades.
